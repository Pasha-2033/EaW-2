# Division template historical names system. Is a new method of naming the divisions based on the names-group assigned to it's template.
# If we run out of all historical names, the names will be assigned in the old way (name/fallback_name).
# Each group has a made up tag. Use it if you want to append more, or replace existing names with the extra txt files (modding).
# %d - is decimal value (example: 14), %s - is string value (ROMAN! Example: XIV)
<NAME_TAG> = {
    name = "<DIVISION_NAME>" #for old naming mechanic
    #Lists all countries that can use it. If empty, or entire tag is missing, all countries in the world can use it.
    for_countries = {
        <TAG>
        VES
    }
    #Trigger that locks/unlocks the group under specific circumstances. 
    #The trigger is in a country scope. Can skip if will contain always = yes
    can_use = {
        <trigger>
        has_government = communism
    }
    #List of tokens to corresponding unit types. 
    #A player can in fact use any group of names for a division template
    #However this tag is a helper for an automated choice (for AI, or if the group must switch on it's own, because for example the current one is no longer available due to the can_use trigger saying so).
    #In automated choice, the division template must have at least 1 of the following types for it to be chosen.
    #Use unit (common/units) types in double quotes
    division_types = {
        "<unit_type>"
        "jager"

    #Numbers must start from 1 and up. Numbers can't repeat in one scope (country).

    #Numbers must start from 1 and up. Numbers can't repeat in one scope (country).
    #Same index will override if is defined later!
    #All arguments between the brackets must be separated by spaces!
    #1st argument = The name. It must contain %d/%s
    #2nd argument is optional = A localizable text describing this historical division. The text will be visible in the tooltip where you choose the historical division name.
    #3rd argument is optional = An URL preferably pointing to the WIKI. It's a future feature that is not currently working in
